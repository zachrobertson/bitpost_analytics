# BitPost Analytics

This is a program to help gather analytics from the BitPost RSS feed. Later it will be updated to allow for easy scraping of the RSS feed with tools to help with statistical analysis and plotting.

## How to use

Right now there is only one file, `main.py`, you use it by entering names of users you want to scrape the RSS feed of into the `users.txt` file then running the `main.py` file. This will create three different plots, one for the average number of words per post for each user, the other for the total number of images in all articles for each user and the last is the relationship between these two values for each user.
*This is just a very quick program I threw together for day 15 of the BitPost 30 day challenge, it will be updated in the future to do more stuff*
