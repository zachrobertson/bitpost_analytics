This is a program to help gather analytics from the BitPost RSS feed. Later it will be updated to allow for easy scraping of the RSS feed with tools to help with statistical analysis and plotting.

## How to use

Right now there is only one file, `main.py`, you use it by entering names of users you want to scrape the RSS feed of into the `users.txt` file then running the `main.py` file. This will create a few different graphs visualizing the statistics of the BitPost articles from each users in `users.txt`.
